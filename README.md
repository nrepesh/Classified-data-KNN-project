# Classified-data-KNN-project

An anonymized classified data set from a company! Used KNN to create a model that directly predicts a class for a new data point based off of the features. We use the elbow method to choose the best K value for our model. I evaluated the results using an evaluation matrix.

I used Pandas for data analysis and Matplotlib/seaborn for data visualization.
